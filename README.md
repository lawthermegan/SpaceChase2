GAME OVER VIEW AND RULES/INSTRUCTIONS;
Can you catch this unpredictable space critter?
You control the ufo across the screen with your finger or click and hold with mouse. Tap or click anywhere on the screen to start.
The objective is to catch the alien. Important;
Strategic game play - 1 move each player, alien move 1, you move 1.
Machine code understands movement and understands when objects collide resulting in you winning the catch and 'game over' displaying on UI.
